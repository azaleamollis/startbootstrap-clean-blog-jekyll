<p>Hi, I'm Anna Monus, a freelance front-end developer and technical writer. I work with clients from all over the world. I mainly work with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript) and WordPress. 
</p>

<p>Besides coding, I also write about web development, user experience, accessibility, web standards, and other related things. You will find my articles on Godaddy, Hongkiat, Tutsplus, and other popular online magazines.Â On this website, I intend to host my more experimental pieces, mainly on the topics of usability and accessibility.
