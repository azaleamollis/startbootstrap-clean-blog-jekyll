<p>The <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid" target="_blank">CSS subgrid</a> is a new feature coming to browsers. It's already supported by Firefox, but the Chromium team is also <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/06/improving-chromiums-browser.html" target="_blank">working on the implementation</a>. The CSS subgrid allows grid items to adopt the grid tracks and grid lines of the grid container, but only for the area they're spanning over.</p> 
<p>By default, the children of grid items are not part of the grid layout, so without a subgrid feature, you need to create a nested grid and recalculate the grid tracks if you want to use the same grid layout for one or more grid items — 
	however a nested grid and a subgrid are still not the same thing.</p>
<h2>What is CSS subgrid?</h2>
<p>CSS subgrid is a value you can add to the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> properties, for instance:</p>
<pre>
.grid-item {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: subgrid;
	grid-template-rows: subgrid;
}
</pre>
<p>Using this syntax, <code>.grid-item</code> will adopt the grid tracks (rows and columns) of the grid container.</p>
<h2>What is a nested grid?</h2>
<p>A nested grid replicates the grid tracks of the parent grid, however it's still an independent grid.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>inherit</code> value for the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> to create a nested grid, as follows:</p>
<pre>
.grid-item {
	display: inherit;
	grid-template-columns: inherit;
	grid-template-rows: inherit;
}
</pre>
<h2>The difference between a subgrid and a nested grid</h2>
<p>While a nested grid is still independent from the parent grid (we have two grids), a subgrid is the part of it (we have one grid) as the parent grid shares its rows, columns, and lines with it.</p>
<p>For instance, here's an example of a nested grid when being inspected with Google Chrome's grid inspector. As you can see, the parent and nested grid have independent tracks (marked with white vs red):</p>

<p>While, if we create a subgrid, it uses the same grid tracks as the parent grid:</p>

<p>This post is the recap of my longer article about <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/css-subgrid-features-syntax-and-the-problem-itll-solve--cms-33038" target="_blank">CSS subgrid</a> published on TutsPlus Web Design where I analyze the question in detail (the two screenshots above are from this piece as well). I also show there how to simulate a subgrid without having access to the <code>subgrid</code> value.</p>
