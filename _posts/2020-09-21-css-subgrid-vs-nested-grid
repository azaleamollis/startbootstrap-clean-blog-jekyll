<p>The <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid" target="_blank">CSS subgrid</a> is a new feature coming to browsers. It’s already supported by Firefox, but the Chromium team is also <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/06/improving-chromiums-browser.html" target="_blank">working on the implementation</a>. The CSS subgrid allows grid items to inherit the grid tracks of the grid container. By default, the grid layout is not inherited by the children of grid items, so without a subgrid feature, you need to recalculate the grid tracks or use a nested grid — however a nested grid and a subgrid are not the same thing.</p>
<h2>What is CSS subgrid?</h2>
<p>CSS subgrid is a value you can add to the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> properties, for instance:</p>

<pre>
.grid-item {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: subgrid;
	grid-template-rows: subgrid;
}
</pre>

<p>Using this syntax, the children of <code>.grid-item</code> will inherit the grid tracks (rows and columns) of the grid container (their grandparent element).</p>
<h2>What is a nested grid?</h2>
<p>A nested grid inherits the grid tracks of the parent grid, however it’s still an independent grid.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>inherit</code> value for the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> to create a nested grid, as follows:</p>

<pre>
.grid-item {
	display: inherit:
	grid-template-columns: inherit;
	grid-template-rows: inherit;
}
</pre>
<h2>The difference between a subgrid and a nested grid</h2>
<p>While the nested grid is still independent from the parent grid, the subgrid becomes the part of it.</p>

<p>For instance, here’s an example of a nested grid when being inspected with Google Chrome’s grid inspector. As you can see, the parent and nested grid have independent tracks (marked with white vs red):</p>

<p>While, if we create a subgrid, the grid tracks of the parent and child grid will be merged, so the subgrid will use exactly the same grid lines as the parent grid:</p>

This post is the recap of my longer article about <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/css-subgrid-features-syntax-and-the-problem-itll-solve--cms-33038" target="_blank">CSS subgrid</a> published on TutsPlus Web Design that analyzes this question in detail (the two screenshots above are from this piece). It also shows how to perfectly simulate a subgrid without having access to the <code>subgrid</code> value.
