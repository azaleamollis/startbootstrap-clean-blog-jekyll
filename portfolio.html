  <p class="post-meta">LogRocket &ndash; Sept 23, 2020</p>
  <p>Render blocking resources are static files, such as fonts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, that are vital to the process of rendering a web page. When the browser encounters a render blocking resource, it stops downloading the rest of the resources until these critical files are processed. In the meantime, the entire rendering process is put on hold.</p> 
  <p>On the other hand, non-render blocking resources don’t postpone the rendering of the page. The browser can safely download them in the background after the initial page render.</p>

  <p class="post-meta">IBM Cloud Learn Hub &ndash; Feb 18, 2020</p>
  <p>Apache Kafka (Kafka) is an open source, distributed streaming platform that enables (among other things) the development of real-time, event-driven applications. So, what does that mean?</p>
  <p>Today, billions of data sources continuously generate streams of data records, including streams of events. An event is a digital record of an action that happened and the time that it happened. Typically, an event is an action that drives another action as part of a process. A customer placing an order, choosing a seat on a flight, or submitting a registration form are all examples of events. An event doesn’t have to involve a person&mdash;for example, a connected thermostat’s report of the temperature at a given time is also an event.</p>
